Most history professors I have had (this is my 12th History course) write extensive notes in response to your essays, commenting throughout on what they thought was interesting, could need work, and following up with additional sources you can check out. Professor Samin writes a sentence -- ONE SENTENCE -- and a grade. Completely unacceptable, especially for such a small class. \n\nHis essay questions were not engaging. Samin was so obsessed with making sure you did the reading that he never took a step back to think, are the students engaging with the material? What am I trying to have them take away from this course? There was no thoughtfulness. His weekly quizzes reinforced this mantra by asking us odd questions about that weeks readings. The quizzes were weighted more heavily than both of our essays -- what? That makes no sense! This is a history course! \n\nFinally, three of his \"take home assignments\" were short turn around. Why? Why give us four days to write a paper? Again, he put no thought into whether we were engaging with the material. If you want bad papers, giving us four days is a good way to get them. I can't even comprehend the logic behind giving us a weekend to write a five page paper that you've just assigned. What do you gain from that? If you want us to engage with the material, give us time to think over the assignment, come up with a good thesis, and write it. Do you not trust us to take the time to work on it? These short turn around assignments seemed so counter intuitive and reinforced the idea that he did not care if we were learning he just wanted to test us quickly on if we had been doing the homework.

The weekly quizzes were good for reinforcing the material and keeping me in check. The lab write-ups were a lot of work, and my least favorite part of the course. I thought that the exams, especially the final, were well-written and had a good range of questions to test understanding of different parts of the course material.", "I like that the class has a diverse range of assessments that count towards your grade. Its nice having so many assignments a week since accidently messing up one one assignment won't significantly change your grade unlike other classes, however, it is a lot of work and you need to be on top of your tasks or else you can fall behind very quickly.", "Quizzes aren't too hard once you figure out how to study for them. I got a 4/7 on the first one but did a lot better on most of the quizzes later in the class. Same with exams. Workload is very manageable, the reading is due for the quizzes each Monday so most students study and read the textbook over the weekend.

Dr. Hickox also goes over many of these concepts during class before the quiz is distributed. There are four labs which vary in difficulty (TA office hours can help with any questions/directions that are difficult to understand). There is one midterm and one final that is cumulative; they are not difficult if you have stayed engaged in class and with the reading. Every Wednesday we interview a \"guest astronomer\" which is a very interesting opportunity to hear and ask questions about developments in the astronomical community from the leading researchers at the head of these developments. There is one research assignment that gives students the opportunity to delve into a new astronomical finding through a 6-8 page paper (it is organized so that we submit drafts to receive feedback and improve our paper). The workload can be heavy as is usual with lab courses, but it is manageable and not difficult (the material is interesting) if you put forth the effort.", "Too many little assignments.", "Too many random assignments.", "Too many small assignments that don't really affect the grade. I would recommend consolidating them or spreading them out. Other than that, the quizzes and tests were fair and made me think.", "Weekly quizzes were a good way of enforcing an understanding of the content of the course; the essays of the midterm and final also enforced this understanding. Research assignment required a lot more work than expected and did not feel like a way in which I truly engaged in the course. The expected workload of students is appropriate.", "Weekly quizzes were a great method of evaluation that kept me on top of the material and helped my understanding. There were many small assignments that got counted towards our final grade, but I found that this encouraged me to do my best work on every assignment and did help my grade in the end. The big term project research paper was a very challenging but rewarding project, and it really helped us go beyond the course material and understand real scientific literature. The midterm and final exams were both good ways of assessing our progress/understanding of the material. Workload each week consisted of a lot of reading/material to understand each weekend for the Monday quiz, but the fast pace of the term doesn't really allow any better alternatives. Prof. Hickox did a good job of emphasizing the important points we needed to know in lecture.", "Weekly quizzes were very good. Group/individual exercises were also helpful.", "While constant quizzes aren\u2019t extremely fun, they can definitely be effective in making sure we don\u2019t get lost in the course so I think they were well implemented here.", "Workload was unfairly distributed; things that I spent lots of time on (guest astronomer questions) I was not fairly rewarded for (i.e., equal amounts of time to readings, but quizzes count for much more)", "Workload was very consistent which was nice.

It was an absolutely ridiculous workload and borderline cruel to have all that we did leading up to and during finals week. I think he failed to understand that this was a class made up of non-physics majors. And, even if it weren't it had likely the most work of any class I've taken at Dartmouth over the last three years.

It is definitely a lot, but it is worthwhile. Hickox makes sure you are intellectually engaged throughout the entire term, and it's awesome the through the end.", "This course was very overwhelming because I felt like we had an assignment due every other day. Usually during the week we would have the weekly problem set then the questions due for the guest astronomer and then a summary about the guest astronomer. Also we had lab assignments to do, the 10 page paper, midterm and a final.

She never read the labs before coming to lab, and could not, or would not, answer many of our questions.  In the beginning, she said that she wanted the labs to be as short as possible, with minimal introductions and conclusions.  Then, when we were doing lab 4, she told us that the labs were a test of our writing capabilities and that many of us were not up to her standards.  We consistently received mixed messages from her.

I only wanted a sense of whether or not I was going in the right direction, which seems perfectly reasonable for a homework problem that is meant for practice.  I eventually stopped going to her office hours because she was never helpful.  I am very disappointed in my experience with the TA, because I enjoyed the class itself very much.

The numerical projects were also ok, although I thought that they were honestly just a lot of busy work, plugging and plotting equations in mathematica (or matlab for some people).

Basically this course is a full time job, which is a lot to handle while taking two other non-layup courses and playing an in-season varsity sport.  While taking two other courses and playing a varsity sport is specific to me, this course is still an egregious amount of work and I wish they offered an option to take it in a three-term sequence or had a slightly easier version for students who just need it for the MCAT and not for future chemistry courses (like physics 3/4).  I've already commented above about the exams, but one more thing to add is that I wish we had three midterms instead of two.

We didn't have any practice exams to know what the exams were going to be like before taking the exam (especially for the lab practical) and there were questions on the exam that asked for much more detail than Taube said we had to know. On the final exam, there was one question that had a diagram in none of the lecture slides.\nLab practical should not be worth as much (certainly not as much as the midterm) since it does not test any class material, only labs, which we spent a significantly less amount of time doing than learning lecture material. Also, it is a new type of exam format for most students and it is unfair to make it be worth so much.", "First of all, I would like to indicate that this course assessment did not allow me to comment on both instructors, and I resent the inability to write an evaluation of Prof. Jeffrey Taube because I have some major criticisms of his teaching that I would like the opportunity to submit. However, I will find another avenue to address that concern.\n\nThis course would have benefitted from an additional midterm to break up the amount of material covered on each exam. There was too much information packed into each half of the course to reasonably create a test around, especially given the unclear relationships between different sections of the material. In general, I found it difficult to study for the exams because the information presented in class was not structured in such a way that emphasized the relative importance of different topics and details. Everything was presented at once and it made it difficult to anticipate what kinds of questions we would be tested on. At the very least, the first exam was accompanied by a set of practice questions, although the practice questions were not predictive of the level of detail we would be expected to know for the actual midterm exam. We did not even receive practice questions for the final exam. Additionally, Prof. Taube openly told us that he would not finish writing his exam until a few hours before the exam itself, which did not inspire a great deal of trust in him on the part of the students. He had not printed the copies of his half of the exam when our final exam period began, and told us to get started on Prof. van der Meer's half while he left to print his out, which I found highly unprofessional and disrespectful to the students. Given how much effort we put in to study and be prepared for his exam, the bare minimum degree of respect he could afford us would be to have the exam ready on time. This disrespect was especially stinging after Prof. Taube had denied the class the opportunity to take the final exam early because he would not be ready with it in time, even though our exam slot was on the last possible day of exams, and many students had very appropriate reasons for needing to take the exam on an earlier day.\n\nThe laboratory practical, unlike the exams, was fair and commensurate with the expectations set out for us by the TAs. The lab write-up for the Morris Water Maze lab was also fairly well done, although the expectations for that assignment not entirely consistent between Prof. Taube and the TAs. Since ultimately the TAs were evaluating that assessment, I trusted their articulation of the expectations for the write-up, but it was disheartening and confusing that the professors and the TAs were not on the same page.", "Good, but I felt like I had over-studied.", "It was hard to prepare for because there was only one midterm and one exam.

We had a lot of material to go through.", "I want to use this section to reiterate my comment from earlier in this evaluation that PSYC 65: Systems Neuroscience needs to be fundamentally reorganized and rebuilt.\n\nThe learning objectives for the course are not clear, and the current organization of the material has no clear structure. The course material is presented as if we are expected to simply memorize every detail of every slide, rather than in such a way that emphasizes clear key concepts and themes. I found it difficult to discern what the important ideas and core concepts were, and instead felt as though I was being taken through dozens of different fields' worth of content without learning about what related those fields to each other. The value of a course entitled \"Systems Neuroscience\" should be that it defines what constitutes a neural \"system,\" elucidating the commonalities that underlie each system, and then that it illustrates the defining features of each key system that are unique and/or important. I do not feel that I understand those things after taking this course; instead I feel that the course has taught me to keep track of extremely detailed, isolated clusters of information at inconsistent levels of depth across a disparate and selection of topics. The lack of cohesive organization extended through to the structure of the exams, which were actually divided into two portions written separately by each professor\u2014a clear and disappointing manifestation of the fact that the course's organizers did not make efforts to synthesize the course's information into a cohesive body of knowledge but rather left the material to be presented in broken pieces. I do not say this out of malice or ill-will, but rather out of frustration with a department that has otherwise generated courses that are well-organized with clear learning objectives and logical concept/topic selections. The instructors of this course need to critically reexamine the purpose of this course and the concepts they intend to teach through it, and rebuild the course to reflect those learning objectives, because as it stands right now the course does not befit the title of \"core requirement\" for the neuroscience major.

The homework exercises emphasize slowly working through problems in an untimed setting over the coarse of a whole week. However, the examinations were down to a very hard time crunch and tested your ability to do similar problems in a strictly timed setting. This made little sense to me, as throughout the course all of the practice we did was on slowly working through difficult problems, not grinding through them and trying to scrape together as many points as possible in 3 hours. When your test medians are in the 60s, it becomes sort of arbitrary as an evaluation method, as your grade comes down to the grader happening to sympathize with whatever fleeting thought you had while sitting down during those 3 hours, and not with your overall understanding. I'd say either modify the practice and the homework to more time-intensive exercises, such as have problems be due every night, or change the test format to allow students more time to work through the problems. It makes little sense to test students on their ability to do timed exercises when all that they've practiced is untimed exercises.", "I don't like how the tests were timed, because I always feel pressured by the time and feel I can't do my best even if I studied and knew the material.", "I found the workload to be appropriate and the methods of evaluation (ie exams) were very fair in their coverage of material learned in class.", "It's a very reasonable workload: just class exercises and a problem set every week. The tests are fair, and he gives you enough time to complete them.", "Most of the grade came down to the tests, and although homework mattered, it wasn't terribly influential, which was nice. I think it is good as is.", "The assessments are inaccurate evaluations of the mastery of course material. The homework focused on somewhat advanced applications of the material. I think they would have been better organized to have some questions that lead the student form basic to complex - in the manner that the LLM-drawn questions are made. The exams too focused only on assessing relatively advanced comphrension of the material - I would suggest more questions testing basic understanding.\n\nI know this sounds like basic whining that the class is too hard, but I really think that the exams do not measure the continuum of mastery from basic to advanced, but rather a dichotomy of understanding (either you got it, or you don't)", "The examinations don't fit the style of the class. Proofs take time and consequently, I ran out of time on every exam. This suggests that there either needs to be more time, less questions or just make exams take home exams. Take home exams will be a better fit anyways because it's unreasonable to expect a 3 hour exam to accurately gauge someone however, if time were irrelevant then you are actually assessing knowledge and not test-taking speed / ability. I'd have done much better in the course if there were more time available which is a shame considering 70% of our grade comes from the exams. Speed doesn't necessarily dictate how well one knows the material.\n\nAlso, maybe more weight could be given to homework or the in class problems. Homework is only 15% however, it was more representative of \"real-world\" problem solving since we weren't in a timed setting.\n\n", "The workload is heavy - both in terms of the volume of problems for weekly assignments and in terms of the difficulty of the problems.

There is absolutely more than one way to approach a problem, and yet, in exams AND homeworks, students are penalized by not strictly adhering to what's written in the answer key, EVEN if the student is sticking to the way he is taught in class!\n\nThus, students suffer substantial grade loss not because they cannot effectively answer the questions, but because the people grading the questions - out of hardheadedness - simply want to stick to what's written in the answer key, believing it to be the absolute way to answer the questions. \n\nThis artificially fluctuates students' grades, as the students cannot guess *in which way* the answer key is written, doesn't actually test the students' understanding and ability to answer the question proficiently, and creates massive frustration.", "Very good!", "Workload is reasonable.

The last one I passed in was 26 pages. While they take a lot of time, they are extremely useful in reinforcing our understanding of the material. In each report we have to craft a \"Theory\" section that explains how the devices work. This was my most effective learning tool in this class.

Additionally,  I was still responsible for knowing all the field trip information for the final, even though I had not been on the field trips and the make up assignments did not cover that same information.  I had to work much harder than my able-bodied peers to make sure I got the most out of this class.  \n\nI want to be able to take further EARS classes and go on the Stretch, but I need those classes to be accommodating of disabilities in order for me to do so.

In general tough, I felt that to a certain degree, it was the mere timing of the tests that was standing in the way of higher test scores. I found that in the process of rushing through the test, I often found out that there were one or two simple, obvious mistakes that I would have easily noticed given enough time to check over my responses: mistakes which were worth considerable percentage points.

The class has a big amount of workload but, if managed correctly, it's not that bad. \n", "The grading of assignments (quizzes, midterm, essay, and final) were all very fair and because they were difficult and regarded specific information from a large group of readings the final grade of the class was curved. There was never a question on an assessment which I thought was unfair to ask or unclear and when these issues were raised Professor Carey always had a resolution which was fair to all the students. The workload of the class was heavy (readings for every class, could take hours to read and take notes on) but I never felt the reading and amount was obsessive, unfair or irrelevant.", "The methods were incredible. The class was engaging and fun. I looked forward to it.", "The pop quizzes were a nice way to stay on top of readings. The midterm and final were way too specific. To study for them you would have to re-read al the courses in the class and memorize specific examples. That would be over 2000 pages of reading and is unrealistic. The multiple choice part of exams only tested memorization not actual understanding or knowledge. The essay questions were good however.", "The tests and multiple-choice tests questions were completely out of left field. The questions were not on broad topics as expects, but rather minute details in the readings. The essay portions of the tests were great! Also, the quizzes were fantastic.", "The workload for the course was as advertised by the professor. We typically had between 2-4 hours of reading per day of class. The readings were typically between 50-120 pages, and I always took notes. There was a midterm exam, a paper, and a final exam. The workload is definitely manageable, but it may take much longer to complete work for this class if you are a slower reader.", "The workload is heavy but almost always necessary. 3.5 to 4 hours was challenging, but I think necessary. The papers were well done forms of evaluation with well-written prompts to help us sum up what we knew. I think that the midterm and final multiple choice questions could stand to be less detail-oriented and more thematic. Many questions were about nitpicky details from literally over 100 hours of reading, so I think it would be better to focus on the bigger picture lessons we can take away. I was luckily fine with the nitpicky details, but I didn't feel like I was properly assessed.", "There are pop quizzes throughout the term.

While I understand that the paper is supposed to be a culmination of the learned material with lots of work put in, the reality is that many many more hours were spent on average by each student in discussion and preparing for discussion. given that discussion was literally the entire class every class the entire term, I think much more weight should be given to discussion rather than the paper. With regards to the discussion leadership groups, while the idea is effective, I don't think its fair that so much of that great depends on whether one's classmates did the assigned reading. Some groups had excellent questions and presentations, but it was clear that the class hadn't done much if any of the reading that week. Along those lines, the assignment of discussion groups was at times quite unfair. Some groups had to present on ~250 pages of reading while the following group only had to present on ~80-100. Not only is that substantially more work for the presenters in terms of preparation, it also greatly diminishes the chances that the rest of the class complete more than a quarter to half of the reading, putting the presenters in a difficult position", "I thought it was all very balanced. However, I think we could've had just one week where we present rather than two. I felt I got much more out of the response papers than the discussion groups. The discussion groups felt more of a hassle to get together and didn't really help much, and everything we did I felt that could've been organized into the structure of the class to begin with. The workload was expected for a seminar level course. The reading was a bit on the heavy side - at least for me - because of the technical nature of some of the reading.", "The evaluation methods were fair, and I appreciated the reading responses.

Paper and written work was good though.", "Reading workload was reasonable for the nature of the course.", "Regular pop quizzes aren't that hard if you've done the reading. The papers are challenging and requires you to be genuinely interested in political science.

However, professor Carey is a very fair grader and will give you the credit you deserve.", "Tests were hard but doable. Paper concept was excellent and I really enjoyed writing mine. I do wish my paper could have been longer.", "The class provides a heavy but not overly burdensome amount of work. There is a good amount of reading per class, and intermittent pop quizzes mean that not doing your reading can sometimes stab you in the back. The pop quizzes are usually fine and should not be too much trouble as long as you have a good understanding of the material in the reading. Other than that, the only sources of work are the midterm, final, and a few essays. For the midterm, there is a multiple choice and short answer section that asks you to understand and extrapolate concepts from readings and lectures. There is also a timed essay that begins as soon as you finish the multiple choice section and ends at 9PM that night. I appreciate being given these extra few hours to complete the essay, as it allowed me to add outside sources and better examples to improve the quality of my writing. The final was much the same, except that the class was given three hours to complete both the multiple choice and timed write sections, which made me feel a little bit rushed. Finally, the Monkey Cage essay was one of my favorite assignments of the class, because it allowed me the freedom to pick a topic of my choice and construct an argument around it using outside information and data. I found the parameters of the assignment and the lack of a time limit extremely freeing when writing this essay.", "The instructor used tests (multi choice + essay portion), and two papers. Expectations were not really clear on the essays.", "The pop quizzes were effective I regret to say.

The midterm was a very fair assessment of course material, and the problem sets, too, were fair and a good reinforcer of what we'd discussed in class, although a few of the problem sets had some incredibly difficult problems that very few students could answer correctly. But some could. The midterm was straightforward by virtue of the simplicity of the content learned up to that point. It would require little preparation for the student who had done the problem sets and the readings (perhaps about 7 or 8 hours of work in total per week up to the midterm) but would be overwhelming for the student who had pushed off most of the work until then. The final, however, is hard. The content becomes more subjective and intricate following the midterm, with a higher demand of creativity of thought, and depending on how far the class goes (the syllabus is somewhat flexible), the material can make large leaps in conceptual difficulty in just a couple of chapters. None of the material is out of reach for those who have a decent grasp of calculus/algebra and basic logic, but I'd think that even for the smartest, one would have to work hard to understand some of the concepts. They just aren't always intuitive, though when you sit at your desk for hours on end, staring at your textbook blankly and hopelessly until the clock strikes 3AM, the reasoning will hit you in a flash of insight. You will rejoice. In light of all of this, I highly recommend this course. It's a necessary challenge. I am leaving the class feeling much more confident in my ability to problem-solve and to reason objectively, and as the course description suggests would happen, I feel that I view the world differently now\u2014through a more strategic lens.
